# Object Localisation Using Class Activation Map ( CAM):
CAM is a weighted activation map generated for each image. It helps to identify the region a CNN is looking at while classifying an image. CAMs arenâ€™t trained supervised, but in a weakly supervised fashion.


# Object Localisation Using Gradient:
Generate a heat map by computing the gradient of the output score with respect to the input image.
